# A method tracking mobile robot indoor environment using ceiling camera using YOLOv9
-  Developed a localization system for mobile robots using a ceiling-mounted camera
combined with the YOLOv9 deep learning network.
- Replaced traditional QR code tagging with YOLOv9 to improve robustness against noise
and lighting variations.
- Performed coordinate transformation from camera coordinates to cartesian coordinates to
determine the robot’s precise position.
- Validated the approach by successfully recording the robot’s entire trajectory inside a mazelike indoor environment
